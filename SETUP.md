GitHub Repository Setup Guide
Follow these steps to create a GitHub repository with your cruise packing list application:

Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub.com and sign in
Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
Select "New repository"
Fill in the details:
Repository name: cruise-packing-manager (or your preferred name)
Description: Comprehensive cruise packing list manager with weather predictions
Visibility: Choose Public or Private
Do NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
Do NOT add .gitignore (we already have one)
Do NOT choose a license (we already have MIT license)
Step 2: Prepare Your Local Repository
Open terminal in your project directory and run:

# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init
# Add all files to staging
git add .
# Make initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Cruise packing list manager with weather predictions"
# Add your GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/cruise-packing-manager.git
# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
Replace YOURUSERNAME with your actual GitHub username!

Step 3: Verify Upload
Refresh your GitHub repository page
You should see all your files including:
README.md with full documentation
All source code (client/, server/, shared/)
